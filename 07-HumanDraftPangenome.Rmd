# Draft Human Pangenome Reference

![https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x](./Figures/HumanPangenomePaper.png){width=60%}

## Samples
47 phased, diploid genomes (aim for 350)

* 29 lymphoblastoid cell lines \
    + “limiting selection to those lines classified as karyotypically  normal and with low passage (to avoid artefacts from cell culture)” 


* 18 sequenced by others (some supplemented) \
    + Aimed for “genetic and biogeographic diversity”

## Strategy

**Sequencing** \

PacBio HiFi \
Oxford Nanopore \
Bionano optical maps \
High-coverage Hi-C \
Illumina short-read sequencing \
High-coverage Illumina sequencing data for both parents

**Assembly**\

Trio-HiFiasm

**Graphs** \

<span style="color: green;">*Minigraph*</span> \
* Fast pangenome graph builder based on the minimap2 aligner \
* Only structural variation >=50nt

<span style="color: green;">*Minigraph-Cactus (MC)*</span> \
* Refines minigraph output to include SNPs and other small variants \
* Rewrote minigraph to write chains of minimizers \
* Rewrote cactus to be able to read in minigraph output

<span style="color: green;">*PanGenome Graph Builder (PGGB)*</span> \
* All pairwise genome assembly alignments -> graph \
* Uses graph normalization to make sure that chromosome paths are linear \
* Allows for cyclic graph structures that capture structural variation.

## Results

**More Genetic Variation Captured**

<span style="color: green;">*The pangenome captures more polymorphic sequences*</span>

* 119 Mb of euchromatic polymorphic sequences
  * 90 MB = structural variation

* 1,115 gene duplications


<span style="color: green;">*We can align more (short) reads to the pangenome*</span>

<!-- If we had captured all human diversity in the pangenome, the regression lines wouldn't slope downward; the most diverse samples are still not finding perfect matches for all their reads-->

<span style="color: green;">*We can call more variants more accurately*</span>

Aligning short reads to the pangenome

* lowered error in small variants by 34%\
* increased structural variants calls per haplotype by 104% (“vast majority”)



<span style="color: green;">*We can call variants across a broad set of populations*</span>

<!-- "Small variants" -->
